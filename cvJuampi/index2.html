            <div class="divParrafo"><p>I introduce myself. My name is Juan Pablo, and I'm from Argentina living in berlin with a student visa since a year ago, I'm 29 years old and I'm interested in work with you.
                After finishing high school, I started a career in Computer Engineering, and after a year I changed to Computer Systems Analyst.
                Unfortunately, after 3 years of study, I had to start working, not being able to finish with these.
                In the year 2020, I left Argentina and lived 1 year in Copenhagen, Denmark, the following year, I came to Berlin where I live now.
                I am physically prepared for heavy work, and I have good knowledge about electricity and electronics. 
                I have experience with handling heavy electronic equipment, In Denmark I worked in a scooter repair company, where I and my team were in charge of moving, fixing and registering the batteries of the scooters.
                I am studying German, at the moment it is basic, but improving.
                Is it possible to have a personal interview to get to know each other?</p></div>
